Integrating OpenAI Python SDK with Cursor AI
Overview
Cursor AI is an AI-powered code editor that enhances development workflows by integrating with large language models like OpenAI's GPT. By leveraging the OpenAI Python SDK, developers can access OpenAI's API directly within Cursor, enabling features such as code generation, debugging assistance, and more.

Installation
Install the OpenAI Python SDK:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install openai
Set Up API Key:

Ensure your OpenAI API key is set as an environment variable:

bash
Copy
Edit
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
Usage Example
Here's a basic example of using the OpenAI Python SDK to generate a completion:

python
Copy
Edit
import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-003",
    prompt="Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number.",
    max_tokens=150
)

print(response.choices[0].text.strip())

Chat Panel: Interact with the AI assistant in a conversational manner to ask questions, get explanations, or generate code snippets.
