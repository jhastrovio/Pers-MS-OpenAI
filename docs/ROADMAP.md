## 🔄 Version Control

- Each component follows semantic versioning (X.Y.Z)
- Major version (X): Phase number
- Minor version (Y): Component number
- Patch version (Z): Implementation iteration

## 📝 Notes

- All code should include unit tests and documentation
- Each component should be independently deployable
- Monitor vector store usage to stay within 10k document limit
- Regular backups of OneDrive data required
- Integration tests have been implemented for all Phase 1 components
- Vercel deployment provides serverless API hosting with automatic scaling
- Document processing includes OCR capabilities for scanned documents
- MSAL authentication is required for Microsoft Graph API access
- NLTK and tiktoken are used for advanced text processing
