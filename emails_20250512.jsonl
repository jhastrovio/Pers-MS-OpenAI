Had we continued with it, it would have been at 21.94. We then moved to JH003 on 6 Feb, which was the new one I had been working on for some time (second chart). Had we kept JH003 it would be at 16.38. But luckily, we increased the risk aversion parts in this portfolio 4 March, which saved us some in recent days. Last chart below is the actual JH portfolio at 18.35.\nBottom line: The old JH would have done better overall, but not in the last few days, where our current JH was the best performer. Also, it is good that we increased the risk aversion stuff recently as it saved us 2%.", "attachments": [], "has_attachments": false, "importance": "normal", "categories": []}

Busy days\u2026\nTo be honest, I am amazed that his idea only lost 2.1% given what happened in equities. But I guess part of my initial analysis was correct. Markets were already quite long JPY. As a result downside was limited. That doesn\u2019t make it a win but one has to take manageable risks.\nFor the avoidance of confusion, this trade idea was closed at noon at 142.26 as scheduled in the original writeup.

The underlying assumption that Trump\u2019s tariffs were fully priced was incorrect as they exceeded all expectations in magnitude. However, we had more luck with our prediction that the positioning was very long Yen already. As a result, the Yen rally was very muted relative to the extent of the equity decline.\nClosing long USDJPY as scheduled at today\u2019s midday BST fix at 146.26, opened at 149.42 (-2.1%)\nThomas Stolper\nSYSTEMACRO Research\n+44 8191 9181", "attachments": [], "has_attachments": false, "importance": "normal", "categories": []}

This notable, because Friday marked a significant change in correlation from recent weeks, with the Dollar suddenly changing direction and strengthening despite\r\n continued equity weakness. Some of the moves seen in AUD or the Scandies were rather remarkable on Friday and a complete reversal of (puzzling) price action in recent weeks.\nMuch of this may have to do with FX hedging of US exposure. I discussed this in a Deep Dive published late on Friday evening (link below).\nStart of the year \u2013\nForeign investors are overweight US equity and less FX hedged than usual.\nFebruary/March\n\u2013 President Trump\u2019s policy uncertainty makes investors sell FX unhedged overweight positions in the US. This triggers\nUSD selling combined with SPX weakness.\nBetween end of March and last Thursday\n\u2013 Equity allocations and FX hedges have reached the benchmark on average as a result of selling since February and the SPX drop last week.\nThursday/Friday\n\u2013 SPX continues to fall. Suddenly overseas investors end up over-hedged relative to the sharp decline in the underlying equity portfolio. This leads to\nDollar buying because stocks weaken.\nIn a sense FX markets appear to have normalised. Currencies where local pension funds are known to hedge their FX exposure (Scandis, AUD, CAD) saw a particularly sharp reversal. But the EUR has also started to drop.\nFX hedge adjustments don\u2019t necessarily happen intraday. I would guess the typical pension fund looks at the previous day\u2019s closing valuation and calculates the trades the required hedge adjustment next day. Some may even act on a weekly\r\n basis. It is therefore possible that the FX hedge adjustment linked to Friday\u2019s sell-off will only come through on Monday.\nGoing forward, there is an\nadditional risk\nfor a feedback loop. I don\u2019t think we are there yet but we have seen this at work back in 2008 and 2020.\nThis is what happens:\nDollar strengthens\nAsset managers need to raise cash for FX margin calls on Dollar short positions\nThis forces them to sell underlying assets.\nAs asset values decline, they are again over-hedged and have buy back USD to align their FX hedge book.\nThis leads to further USD strength and more margin calls.\nDuring these vicious feedback loops, we also typically see USD funding stress, which makes sense given that selling USD vis FX forwards involves USD borrowing.\nWhen markets consolidate and rebound, even if temporary, these correlations will then typically work the other way. SPX strength would then be associated with USD weakness. And if part of the rebound has been triggered by Fed easing, narrowing\r\n interest rate differentials could create and incentive to increase FX hedge ratios, meaning more USD selling \u2013 but it is for the future. For now, we remain focusses on USD strength in response to SPX weakness.\nFX Hedging of Credit?\nIt is worth spending a thought about credit also. As a fixed income security, the FX hedge ratios are likely far higher than for more volatility US equity exposure. If credit spreads suddenly widen more than government bonds rally, some\r\n fixed income portfolios may come under pressure also. The dynamics are largely the same except that credit is notoriously illiquid when the going gets tough, and marking to market a challenge. This could trigger put some of the FX hedging dynamics with a slow\r\n fuse.\nPossible SNB Intervention\nThere is one central bank that only recently re-affirmed that they are concerned about\nlow\ninflation and that they are ready to intervene again. I am obviously talking about the SNB. The CHF has strengthened further in early trading today, with EURCHF sitting right at the lows again. There is one reason for the SNB to not intervene and\r\n that is US tariffs and negotiations with the US administration.
