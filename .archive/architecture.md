# Pers MS Open AI - Architecture

Version: 10 May 2025

---

## üéØ Overview

The Pers MS Open AI is a scalable, future-proof AI assistant that integrates Outlook emails and OneDrive documents into a ChatGPT experience. All LLM/AI (RAG, chat, file_search, etc.) is accessed via OpenAI (openai Python SDK, Responses API). Azure is only used for Microsoft Graph, Key Vault, and monitoring‚Äînot for LLM/AI.

**All LLM/AI and embedding calls must go through the OpenAIService class (`openai_service` instance) for consistency. Do not use direct OpenAI API calls elsewhere in the codebase.**

This document defines the system architecture.

## üì¶ Component Breakdown

### 0Ô∏è‚É£ Custom GPT (ChatGPT) + Actions

* Users interact with a Custom GPT in ChatGPT, configured with Actions that call a lightweight proxy endpoint.
* No custom web front-end is required; all UX is native to ChatGPT.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Tiny Proxy (FastAPI, Cloudflare Worker, etc.)

* Receives Action calls from the Custom GPT.
* Forwards requests to the OpenAI Responses API (with file_search and the project's vector store).
* Can be extended for logging, reranking, or custom business logic.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ FastAPI Orchestrator

* Main API entry point for backend automation and ingestion (not user-facing).
* MSAL OAuth2 middleware for authentication
* Routes requests to appropriate handler modules
* Logs metrics to Application Insights

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Intent Classifier

* Classifies user intent: `email`, `drive`, or `mixed`
* Enables targeted retrieval pipeline execution

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Ingest Pipelines

* `graph_ingest.py`: Outlook Graph API ‚Üí JSONL converter (one email per line/object, with metadata, body, and attachment references)
* `onedrive_ingest.py`: OneDrive watcher ‚Üí document and attachment upload
* `ingest.py`: Unified file upload to OpenAI File Search with polling
* **All uploads (emails, attachments, docs) use the OpenAI SDK GA Vector Store endpoints, attaching metadata via the `attributes` field.**
* **REST API workarounds are no longer required.**
* **Metadata-based search and filtering is supported; check OpenAI docs for latest filter syntax.**
* Attachments are stored in OneDrive and referenced in the email JSONL by file ID or URL. Attachments are also uploaded to File Search as separate files, with metadata linking them to their parent email.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ OpenAI Responses API Layer

* `chat_handler.py`: Connects to OpenAI via `responses.create()`
* file\_search tool attached for document retrieval
* Handles streaming + async completions where needed

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Processing & Formatting

* `response_formatter.py`: Adds inline citations (filename + page)
* Attaches confidence scores to response text

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Azure Functions (Live Sync)

* Runs 5-min cron jobs to check Graph delta changes
* Triggers re-ingest for any changed bundles

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring + Budget Alerts

* Application Insights: latency, precision dashboards
* Trigger alerts when file count nears 9,500 or usage spikes

## ü™ú Scaling Path

| Trigger                        | Action                                              |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| file\_count > 10,000           | Reindex into Azure AI Search (hybrid BM25 + vector) |
| > 300 queries/day avg          | Same as above                                       |
| Swap action vector\_store\_ids | Zero downtime transition                            |

## üîê Security Considerations

* MSAL OAuth2 flow (service principal)
* JWT + API Key authentication fallback
* Key Vault rotation pipeline (90-day)
* Purview PII redaction on document ingestion
* OWASP ASVS security review

---

## üìù Notes

* file\_search tool (OpenAI-managed vector index, 10k file limit)
* Azure AI Search provides hybrid BM25 + vector retrieval beyond file\_search scale
